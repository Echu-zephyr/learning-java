System_Override: Neon Protocol
A modular, text-based narrative engine implemented in Java. This repository serves as a structured environment for mastering the core fundamentals of software engineering and Java syntax.

Project Architecture
The project is built in iterative phases to ensure clean code and logical separation of concerns:

Phase 1: Program Entry – Initializing the JVM entry point and standard I/O.

Phase 2: Data Persistence – Implementing primitive data types for state management.

Phase 3: Interactive Streams – Handling user input via the Scanner class.

Phase 4: Logic Gates – Branching narrative paths using conditional control flow.

Phase 5: Operational Logic – Utilizing arithmetic operators for game economy and status updates.
